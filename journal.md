# Title
Reactions of carbonate minerals within the high temperature environments of gas turbine engines
# Introduction
In nature, abundant carbonate minerals such as dolomite and calicite are known to form high temperature phases such as melilite, the solid solution of akermanite and gehlenite. Due to the high temperatures of the high pressure turbines of a gas turbine engine it is concievable that these phases could form at this location. 
# Conclusions
Dust is dusty
